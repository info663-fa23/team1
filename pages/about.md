## About CollectionBuilder CSV
About the Collection

This catalog depicts works of Italian Renaissance art by painters from the Venetian school, collected by the Photo Archive of the Berenson Library at Harvard’s Villa I Tatti. 

The photographs chosen are from the “Homeless Paintings of the Italian Renaissance” project, wherein the current locations are unknown by the curators of our Photo Archives.

The backs of the photographs have stamps and handwritten inscriptions describing the works of art as well as the photographs themselves. More than one photograph may depict the same work of art. 

Our mission is to create a catalog for art historians who may be hoping to learn more about the works of art themselves, as well as the whereabouts of the works.

#This demo collection features items from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections]#(https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/), and is build using [CollectionBuilder-CSV](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-csv).

#CollectionBuilder-CSV is a "Stand Alone" template for creating digital collection and exhibit websites using Jekyll, given:

#- a CSV of collection metadata
#- a folder of images, PDFs, audio, or video files

#Driven by your collection metadata, the template generates engaging visualizations to browse and explore your objects.
#The resulting static site can be hosted on any basic web server.

#[CollectionBuilder](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/) is an set of open source tools for creating digital collection and exhibit websites that are driven by metadata and powered by modern static web technology.
#See [CB Docs](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/) for detailed information.
