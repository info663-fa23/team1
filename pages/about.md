About the Collection

This catalog depicts works of Italian Renaissance art by painters from the Venetian school, collected by the Photo Archive of the Berenson Library at Harvard’s Villa I Tatti. 

The photographs chosen are from the “Homeless Paintings of the Italian Renaissance” project, wherein the current locations are unknown by the curators of our Photo Archives.

The backs of the photographs have stamps and handwritten inscriptions describing the works of art as well as the photographs themselves. More than one photograph may depict the same work of art. 

Our mission is to create a catalog for art historians who may be hoping to learn more about the works of art themselves, as well as the whereabouts of the works.
